Go is a *pass-by-value* language. *Passing* functions the *value* of an argument. Go compiler strictly uses the **value** of the argument rather than the argument itself, thus changes that take place in the function stay within the function.

With *addresses*, *pointers*, and *dereferencing*, we can  change values from different scopes.
